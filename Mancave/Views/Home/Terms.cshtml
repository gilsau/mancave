            Terms & Conditions
            Date of Last Revision: March 8, 2014


            Statement of Rights and Responsibilities

            This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Mcave Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Mcave. By using or accessing Mcave, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Mcave works.


            1. Privacy

            Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Mcave to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.  We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
 
            2. Sharing Your Content and Information

            Once you post, Mcave owns all of the content and information you post on Mcave, while you can continue to control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
            1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Mcave (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
            2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
            3. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Mcave, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
            4. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Mcave, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
 
            3.        Your Membership
            You will keep your password a secret.
            You will not share an account with anyone else.
            You will not copy or transfer any part of the Service.
            The profile you create on Mcave will become part of Mcave and except for the information that you license to us is owned by Mcave. However, between you and others, your account belongs to you. You agree to: (1) keep your password secure and confidential; (2) not permit others to use your account; (3) not use other’s accounts; (4) not sell, trade, or transfer your Mcave account to another party; and (5) not charge anyone for access to any portion of Mcave, or any information therein. Further, you are responsible for anything that happens through your account until you close down your account or prove that your account security was compromised due to no fault of your own. To close your account, please contact Mcave at the contact link.

            4. Access Point Terms
            1. A User is someone who has created a profile.
            2. An Active Member is a User, and in addition, adheres and maintains the following:
            a. Has logged in and performed an act, or comment, or post, within the past 5 calendar days.
            b. Posts at least 10 comments in a calendar month.
            c. If purchases are available, a member must purchase an item at least once a year.
            d. Has updated their profile to have completed all of the following; profile demographics, photos, calendar, club, video, and at least one activity (such as ManSports, ManStocks, Fight Ticker, etc.)
            1. A Visitor is a web browser that views a user or members page.
            2. A Accessed Partner is the spouse or partner of a User or Member that is granted limited access through the View Only Feature.
            2. Social Share E-Commerce Feature
            1. Users, Members, and Guests will hold Mcave harmless for any changes in these terms and conditions, or the changes in the functionality of the website or its partners.
            2. Users, Members, and Guests will have no decision making capability or access to company financial documents or performance information, regardless of the implication or mis-information provided by this document.  
            3. Agreements said here in this clause, as well as all others in these Terms and Conditions, are subject to partial or complete change at any time, without notice to Member or User, or anyone else.  
            4. Active Members will be able to receive a portion of Mcave’s profits. 
            5. That portion, which will be 5% of Mcave’s total profits, which hereinafter will be called an “award”, will be shared by all “Active Members”; meaning, that 5% of Mcave’s annual total profit will be split up evenly amongst all Active Members.
            6. Active Members will be sent a message to their Mcave profile inbox notifying them of their award, and must reply within 5 calendar days, at which time, they will be given instructions on how to use that money in the Manstore for purchases and discounts.  Users, Members, and Guests will hold Mcave harmless and not liable for any mis-information communicated in these notifications.  Mcave is not held liable for the reporting substance or accuracy of such revenue share to Users, Members, and Guests, or the accuracy thereof.
            7. At this time, all awards must be used for purchases within Mcave and its’ partner or Affiliate websites.  
            8. It is the full intention of Mcave and its’ management to grow this opportunity into a full profit share program, which Active Members may, at some point, receive a check in the mail for their award.  However, if this option does not present itself to be financially viable or worthy of merit, it may never happen.  In such a case, Mcave and its management cannot be held any responsibility for such promises or warranties said here in (see 5.1).
            9. Users, Members, and Guests will not have an ability to verify accuracy of perspective payments that they receive.  When money or credit is deposited into the Users, Members, or Guests ManStore account, it is assumed to be accurate.  If an error is suspected, the Users, Members, or Guests may send an email to Mcave representatives or staff. Any such emails or inquiries, may or may not receive a response.   Neither will Users, Members, and Guests have any cause or entitlement of accuracy of financial data or information.  Any payment is a privilege, as Mcave does not have any fiduciary, legal, or implied responsibility to share financial data or information with Users, Members, and Guests, as to the accuracy of any implied payment.  
            3. View Only Feature
            The View Only Feature is the ability for the spouse or partner of a user or member to have their own unique username and password, that the user or member cannot change.  With this access capability, the Accessed Partner will be only able to view the user or members first page, which will show current conversation activity, featured photo and video, and a brief list of friends.  The user or member cannot change a Accessed Partner’s password.  If the user or member wishes to limit the Accessed Partner’s access, that user or member can elect to completely delete that Accessed Partner’s privilege.  In this case, the Accessed Partner will receive an email notifying them that they have been deleted.
            4. Add on features
            1. ManSports will be a fantasy sports portal that will utilize the open source software provided by other affiliate websites or partners.  Mcave is not responsible for the accuracy of all information, data, or performance tracked information from those sites.  If an error should occur, please notify Mcave management or staff.
            a) If there are any concerns about the player choices, performance, or data derived from games or sporting events, you cannot hold Mcave responsible.  You can, however, notify Mcave and we will do our best to correct the issue.
            b) It is the intention of Mcave to reward those that perform well in ManSports by adding money to their account that they can spend in the Manstore.  
            c) All games are meant as an add on feature and can be cancelled, revoked, or terminated, in part, or wholly, at any time.
            1. ManStocks will be a fantasy stock portal that will utilize the open source software provided by other affiliate websites or partners.

It is the intention of Mcave to reward those that perform well in ManStocks by adding money to their account that they can spend in the Manstore.

            2. Fight Ticker will be a fantasy UFC portal that will utilize the open source software provided by other affiliate websites or partners.

If there are any concerns about the fighter choices, performance, or data derived from sporting websites, news outlets, or venues, you cannot hold Mcave responsible.

            4. ManStore will be an E-Commerce portal that will utilize the open source software provided by other affiliate websites or partners.  This E-Commerce portal will link our users or members to the website of a partner or vendor, but still allow Mcave the ability to track that users or members data and activity.  This may or may not require that user or member to use a different username and password, but it is the intention of Mcave to make it appear as seamless as possible.  This Manstore may or may not track shopping habits and choices in an effort to promote or advise other options or promotions.  Mcave is not responsible for the accuracy of all information, data, or performance tracked information from those sites.  If an error should occur, please notify that vendor or partner, as Mcave is merely introducing you to a vendor in an attempt to get you a discount. Mcave may or may not receive incentive or payouts for said shopping. If there are any concerns about the shopping choices, performance, or data derived from shopping websites, you cannot hold Mcave responsible.  You can, however, notify Mcave and we will do our best to correct the issue.  It is the intention of Mcave to reward those that perform well in add ons by adding money to their account that they can spend in the Manstore.  All games and add on features can be cancelled, revoked, or terminated, in part, or wholly, at any time.
            5. ManForum will be an add on feature that allows users or members to carry out conversations with one another.  Users or members will be able to search conversation topics, update existing conversations, and create new topics or conversations.  MCave is not responsible for any of the words, implications, or actions taken by users, members, or others, on Mcave.com or any of its partner or affiliate websites.  Mcave is also not inherently, or otherwise, responsible for any outcome that derives from anyone reading such entries into the ManForum.

            Mcave users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
            1. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
            2. You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.

            5. Protecting Other People's Rights

            We expect all users to respect the rights of others.
            1. If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Mcave) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.

            6. Mobile and Other Devices
            1. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information on Mcave within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.
            2. We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.

            Mcave may offer the Services through applications built using Mcave’s platform (“Mcave Applications”). Examples of Mcave Applications include its smart phone applications (Mcave for Android, Mcave for Blackberry or Mcave for iPhone), and Mcave’s “Share” buttons and other interactive plugins distributed on websites across the web. Mcave Applications are distinct from third party Platform Applications addressed in Section 4.2. If you use a Mcave Application or interact with a website that has deployed a plugin, you agree that information about you and your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, your device, your mobile carrier, your internet access provider, your physical location, or web pages containing Mcave plugins that load in your browser may be communicated to us. Further, by importing any of your Mcave data through the Mcave Application, you represent that you have authority to share the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your Mcave account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing Mcave through your mobile access provider. Therefore, you should check with your provider to find out if the Services are available and the terms for these services for your specific mobile devices. Finally, by using any downloadable application to enable your use of the Services, you are explicitly confirming your acceptance of the terms of the End User License Agreement associated with the application provided at download or installation, or as may be updated from time to time.

            8. Payments

            If you make a payment on Mcave or use Mcave Credits, you agree to our Payments Terms.  Any and all concerns regarding payments made to other vendors or websites, even though introduced by mcave, will be handled through that vendor or website.  And any user of vmanave holds mcave harmless of all wrong doing regarding any and all transactions.

            1. You give us permission to use your name, profile picture, content, and information in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us.

If you have selected a specific audience for your content or information, we will respect your choice when we use it.
            2. We do not give your content or information to advertisers without your consent.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, title, ownership, intellectual property rights, and all other rights and interest in Mcave and all related items, including any and all copies made of the Mcave website.

            2. Limitation of Liability
            We are trying to limit any legal liability we may have to you.
            LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither Mcave nor any of our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, suppliers, employees, shareholders, or directors (“Mcave Affiliates”) shall be cumulatively liable for (a) any damages in excess of five times the most recent monthly fee that you paid for a Premium Service, if any, or US $100, whichever amount is greater, or (b) any special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use of the Service, any Platform Applications or any of the content or other materials on, accessed through or downloaded from Mcave. This limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between the parties and without it the terms and prices charged would be different. This limitation of liability shall:
            Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and
            Not apply to any damage that Mcave may cause you intentionally or knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law, or as otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in this Agreement.
            Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to purchase Premium Services with a separate Limitation of Liability provision that supersedes this section in relation to those Premium Services.

            5. Information we receive and how it is used
            Information we receive about you is property of Mcave and may be used for reasons associated with providing services inherent to the websites goals and business model.
            We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:
            Your information
            Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.
            Registration information:
            When you sign up for Mcave, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender. In some cases, you may be able to register using other information, like your telephone number.
            Information you choose to share:
            Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Mcave, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, comment on a friend's story, update the ManForum, update your resume, etc.

            It also includes the information you choose to share when you communicate with us, such as when you contact us using an email address, or when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, add a place to your story, add a comment to the ManForum.
            Your name, profile pictures, cover photos, gender, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public, and is property of Mcave.
            Your birthday, partners Birthday, or any other event on your calendar allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements, and remind you of opportunities associated with that event.
            Information others share about you
            We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, or add you to a group.
            When people use Mcave, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts.
            Other information we receive about you
            We also receive other types of information about you:
            We receive data about you whenever you use or are running Mcave, such as when you look at another person's calendar, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, use a Mcave mobile app, or make purchases through Mcave.
            When you post things like photos or videos on Mcave, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
            We receive data from or about the computer, mobile phone, or other devices you use to install Mcave apps or to access Mcave, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include network and communication information, such as your IP address or mobile phone number, and other information about things like your internet service, operating system, location, the type (including identifiers) of the device or browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby, or we could request device information to improve how our apps work on your device.
            We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Mcave Platform or visit a site with a Mcave feature (such as a partner link), sometimes through cookies. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Mcave, your User ID.
            Sometimes we get data from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Mcave better. For example, an advertiser may tell us information about you (like how you responded to an ad on Mcave or on another site) in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - ads.
            1. Data Use
            At Mcave, we also put together data from the information we already have about you, your friends, and others, so we can offer and suggest a variety of services and features. For example, we may make friend suggestions, pick stories for your News Feed, or suggest people to tag in photos. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you in which you might be interested. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads or other content that might be more relevant to you.  When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications. We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it no longer personally identifies you.
            2. Public information
            When we use the phrase "public information" (which we sometimes refer to as "Everyone information"), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.
            Information you choose to make public
            Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off Mcave, will be able to see it.

            Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
            can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, calendar, User ID, username, etc.) even off Mcave;
            can show up when someone does a search on Mcave or on a public search engine;
            will be accessible to the Mcave-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and
            will be accessible to anyone who uses our API”s.
            Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something. This is because some types of stories are always public stories.
            When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.
            The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and they are treated just like information you decided to make public:
            Name:
            This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always delete your account.
            Profile Pictures and Cover Photos:
            These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.
            Networks:
            This helps you see who you will be sharing information with before you choose "Friends and Networks" as a custom audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network .
            Gender:
            This allows us to refer to you properly.
            Username and User ID:
            These allow you to give out a custom link to your Page, receive email at your Mcave email address, and help make Mcave Platform possible.
            1. Usernames and User IDs
            Usernames and User IDs are the same thing – a way to identify you on Mcave. A User ID is a string of numbers and a username generally is some variation of your name. With your username, you get a custom link (a Mcave URL, such as www.mcave.com/username) to your activity that you can give out to people or post on external websites.
            If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the mcave.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type mcave.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you through our APIs, such as our Graph API. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, language and country.
            If you do not want your information to be accessible to Platform applications, you can turn off all Platform applications from your Privacy Settings. If you turn off Platform you will no longer be able to use any games or other applications until you turn Platform back on.

            2. How we use the information we receive
            We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:
            as part of our efforts to keep Mcave products, services and integrations safe and secure;
            to protect Mcave's or others' rights or property;
            to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;
            to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to you; and,
            for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.
            Granting us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide Mcave as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.

            Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.
            We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices.
            We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services.
            We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.
            We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures.  
            1. Deleting and deactivating your account
            If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.
            Deactivate
            Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your timeline, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.
            Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated.
            Deletion
            When you delete your account, it is permanently deleted from Mcave. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days.
            Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on Mcave aren't stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.
            If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you may use Mcave Payments only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. Make sure you review these Terms with your parent or guardian so that you both understand all of your rights and responsibilities.

            We have provided some section headers for your convenience, but you should carefully read through these User Payments Terms (the "Terms") in order to understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as ours.


            2. Making Purchases
            Funding and spending. When you make a purchase using Mcave Payments, you agree to provide a valid funding instrument to load money into your electronic value balance. When you have successfully completed this funding transaction, we will then transfer that value to the developer offering the content you wish to purchase.
            Pricing. Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may or may not include taxes, fees, and shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for funding.
            Extra terms. You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm the transaction (such as shipping terms for tangible goods). Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.
            Subscriptions. If you purchase a subscription to an app or to a feature within an app, we will bill your funding instrument immediately, and then again at the beginning of each subscription period. The following terms apply for subscriptions purchased through Mcave Payments:

            1. If a free trial period is offered and you do not cancel during the free trial period, you will be billed at the end of the free trial period and at the beginning of each subsequent subscription period.

            2. You can cancel subscriptions at any time on your Account Settings page.

            3. If you cancel a subscription you will still have access to the app or feature you subscribed to through the end of the subscription period. If an app or feature you subscribed to becomes unavailable during your subscription you will not be billed at the beginning of the next subscription period.
            Actual sale. You may only use Mcave Payments to process a funding transaction for a legitimate, bona fide purchase of a product or service. You may not use Mcave Payments to fund a transaction or otherwise transfer electronic value not in conjunction with a purchase.
            No Warranties. You acknowledge that the products or services you may purchase are sold by merchants, not by Mcave. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD ON OR THROUGH MCAVE.
            3. Payment Methods
            Funding instruments. We want to make Mcave Payments convenient, so we allow you to fund your transactions using a number of different sources, like credit cards and debit cards, Mcave Gift Cards, and other payment methods.
            Authority. When you provide a funding instrument to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that funding instrument. When you fund a transaction, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the funding instrument you designate for the transaction. You also authorize us to collect and store that funding instrument, along with other related transaction information.
            Authorization. If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your purchase. We will bill your card at the time you load funds for your Mcave Payments transaction, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.
            Failed funding. If you fund a payment by debit card and your load transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.

            Incompatibility. You may at some point encounter an app or feature that does not support the payment method you would prefer to use – for example, if an item or feature that you wish to purchase is priced in local currency, you won’t be able to use Credits as a payment method; however, you can select a different type of payment instrument (such as credit or debit card, or mobile operator billing).
            Mobile billing. Mobile operator billing is another payment method we have made available for your convenience. If you use mobile billing as a funding instrument, you consent to the following applicable risks and other terms:

            1. By choosing the mobile billing payment method, you agree that we and your mobile operator may exchange information about you in order to facilitate completion or reversal of payments, resolution of disputes, provision of customer support, or other billing-related activity.

            2. You are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device, or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing.

            3. If you use mobile billing, you are bound not only by these Terms, but also by the terms and conditions of your mobile operator.

            4. If you have questions about any charges or fees that appear on your mobile phone bill, you may contact your mobile provider’s customer service division.

            5. Sometimes, use of mobile billing in a funding transaction may lead to charges that, for various technical reasons beyond our control, cannot be refunded to you. In these cases, we have the right, but not the obligation, to issue you a courtesy credit to your electronic value Balance.

            39.	  Actions We May Take
            1. At-will use. We may revoke your eligibility to use Mcave Payments at any time at our sole discretion.
            2. Inquiries. By using Mcave Payments, you acknowledge and agree that we may make any inquiries that we consider necessary, either directly or through third parties, concerning your identity and creditworthiness.
            3. Right to cancel. We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Terms or the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss. We may also cancel any electronic value accumulated, transferred, assigned, or sold as a result of fraudulent or illegal behavior.
            4. Payment limitations. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may place a delay on a payment for a period of time, or limit funding instruments for a transaction, or limit your ability to make a purchase, or deactivate your account.
            5. Sharing of information. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may contact your funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, or affected third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments you are associated with, if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.
            6. Abandoned Property. If you leave a Balance unused for the period of time set forth by your state, country, or other governing body in its unclaimed property laws, or if you delete your account and leave a Balance, or if we deactivate your account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within six (6) months, we may process your balance in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting funds associated with your Balance to the appropriate governing body as required by law.

            40.      Disputes and Reversals
            1. No liability for spend transaction. If you enter into a transaction with a third party and have a dispute over the goods or services you purchased, we have no liability for the goods or services underlying the transaction. Our only responsibility is to handle your funding transaction. All funding transactions are final unless required by law. If you order something that becomes unavailable before it can be provided to you, you may request a refund of your funded amount.
            2. Duty to notify us. If you believe that an unauthorized or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss. Unless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or otherwise related to the transaction.
            3. Intervention. We may intervene in disputes concerning payments that may arise between you and a developer, but we have no obligation to do so.
            4. Technical difficulties. If you experience a technical failure or interruption of service that causes your funding transaction to fail, you may request that your transaction be completed at a later time.

            41.	Special Provisions Applicable to Advertisers
            1. Agreement to pay. When you purchase advertising or promoted posts on or through Mcave, you agree to pay all amounts specified in the order, along with any applicable taxes.
            2. Consent to credit check. Without limiting Section 3.2 above, your order constitutes your written authorization for us to obtain your personal and/or business credit report from a credit bureau. We may obtain your credit report when you place an order, or at any time thereafter.
            3. Security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your advertising account, and you understand that you will be charged for any orders placed on or through your advertising account.
            4. Direct debit. If you are making direct debit payments, you agree that we can charge you any amount that falls within the range you agreed to upon signup. We will notify you in advance if any charge will exceed the agreed-upon range.
            5. Cancelation. You can cancel an advertising order at any time through our online portal, but your ads may run for several days after you notify us, and you are still responsible for paying for those ads.
            6. Tax liability. It is your responsibility to remit any taxes that apply to your transactions. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of your failure to do so.
            7. Delinquent accounts. If you purchase advertising, and your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may take steps to collect past due amounts using other collection mechanisms. You agree to pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Interest will accrue on any past due amounts at the rate of the lesser of 1% per month or the lawful maximum.


            42.	Notices and Amendments to These Terms
            1. Notice to you. By using the Mcave Payments service, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically any important information regarding your purchases or your account.

Website and email notices shall be considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted or sent; notices by postal mail shall be considered received within three (3) business days of the time sent.

            43.	Additional Terms
            1. Conflict of terms. All of the commitments you make in the Mcave Statement of Rights and Responsibilities apply to your use of Mcave Payments or ManStore.

            44.	Mcave Advertising Guidelines

            Advertising Philosophy
            At Mcave, we believe that ads should contribute to and be consistent with the overall user experience. The best ads are those that are tailored to individuals based on how they and their friends interact and affiliate with the brands, artists, and businesses they care about. These guidelines are not intended to serve as legal advice and adherence to these guidelines does not necessarily constitute legal compliance. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their ads comply with all applicable laws, statutes, and regulations.

            I.    General
            A.    Our Advertising Guidelines consist of advertising content criteria, community standards, and other applicable requirements.
            B.    The Ad Guidelines, as well as our Data Use Policy and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, apply to all ads and commercial content (“ads”) served by or appearing on Mcave (including ads purchased under AAAA/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions).
            C.    Advertising appearing within applications on Mcave Platform must comply with all additional Mcave Platform Policies.
            D.    Ads that are generated through Page posts, and ads that promote a sweepstakes, contest, competition or offer must also comply with the Pages Terms.
            E.    Ads must not contain false, misleading, fraudulent, or deceptive claims or content.
            F.    You may not manage more than one advertiser or client through a single ad account, and may not change the advertiser or client associated with an established ad account.
            G.    If you use custom audiences you must comply with the Custom Audience Terms.

            II.    Data and Privacy
            A.    No data collected, derived or obtained from or in connection with a Mcave ad, including Mcave’s delivery of an ad, and Mcave users’ interaction with a Mcave-served ad (such as information derived from targeting criteria) (“Mcave advertising data”) may be received or used by an entity not acting on behalf of a Mcave advertiser.
            B.    You may not use Mcave advertising data for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns, or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis to assess the performance and effectiveness of your Mcave advertising campaigns. In no event may you use Mcave advertising data, including the targeting criteria for a Mcave ad, to build or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifier that identifies any particular user, browser, computer or device.
            C.    You may use information provided directly to you from users if you provide clear notice to and obtain consent from those users and comply with all applicable laws and industry guidelines.
            D.    You may not directly or indirectly transfer or sell any data to, or use such data in connection with any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other party not acting on behalf of an advertiser and the advertiser’s Mcave advertising campaigns. By indirectly we mean you cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data to an ad network.

            III.    Ad Creative and Positioning
            All components of an ad, including any text, images, or other media, must be relevant and appropriate to the product or service being offered and the audience viewing the ad. Ads may not contain audio or flash animation that plays automatically without a user's interaction or expands within Mcave after a user clicks on the ad. Ads may not position products or services in a sexually suggestive manner. Ads may not contain content that exploits political agendas or "hot button" issues for commercial use. Additionally, ad text must include proper grammar and the use of all symbols, numbers, or letters must adhere to the true meaning of the symbol.
            A.    Accuracy
            Ads must clearly represent the company, product, service, or brand that is being advertised. Products and services promoted in the ad copy must be clearly represented on the landing page, and the destination site may not offer or link to any prohibited product or service. Additionally, ads may not suggest false relevancy to generic offers.
            B.    Attribution
            Ads may not assert or imply, directly or indirectly, within the ad content or by targeting, a user's personal characteristics within the following categories:
            i.    race or ethnic origin;
            ii.    religion or philosophical belief;
            iii.    age;
            iv.    sexual orientation or sexual life;
            v.    gender identity;
            vi.    disability or medical condition (including physical or mental health);
            vii.    financial status or information;
            viii.    membership in a trade union;
            ix.    criminal record; and
            x.    name.
            C.    Destination Sites
            Ads must lead to a functioning landing page that does not interfere with a user's ability to navigate away from the page.
            D.    Images
            Ads and sponsored stories in News Feed may not include images comprised of more than 20% text.
            E.    Targeting
            Ads must always apply appropriate targeting and never use targeting criteria to provoke users. Ads for regulated goods and services (e.g. alcohol and gambling), must abide by all applicable laws, regulations, and industry codes. Specific requirements for dating services, alcohol, gambling, contraceptives and subscription services must adhere to local, state, and federal laws.
            Advertisers must ensure that their ads comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. All claims in ads must be adequately substantiated. Ads must not offend users. Ads and any offers promoted within ads must not be false, deceptive or misleading or contain spam. Ads must not contain or promote illegal products or services. Ads must not violate the rights of any third parties. The following specific content guidelines apply:
            A.    Adult Products

Where a user's age or country cannot be determined, the ad must not be displayed to the user.

            C.    Dating

            G.    Software
            Ads may not contain or link directly or indirectly to a site that contains spyware/malware downloads or any software that results in an unexpected, deceptive or unfair user experience, including but not limited to software which:

            H.    Subscription Services
            Ads for subscription services, or that promote products or services that include negative options, automatic renewal, free-to-pay conversion billing products, or mobile marketing are subject to the following requirements:
            i.    Ad text must clearly and conspicuously disclose the recurring billing component (e.g. "subscription required").
            ii.    The landing page must:
            a.    display the price and billing interval wherever the user is prompted to enter personally identifiable information;
            b.    include an unchecked opt-in checkbox; and
            c.    include language informing users how to cancel their subscription or membership.
            iii.    Each of the foregoing must be located in a prominent place on your landing page, as determined by Mcave in its sole discretion, and should be easy to find, read, and understand.
            I.    Unacceptable Business Model
            Ads may not promote a business model or practice that is deemed by Mcave in its sole discretion to be unacceptable or contrary to Mcave's overall advertising philosophy or to any applicable law, including but not limited to multi-level marketing schemes, or advertisements for scams.
            J.    Weapons and Explosives
            Ads may not promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
            V.    Ad Community Standards
            Ads, or categories of ads, that receive a significant amount of negative user feedback, or are otherwise deemed to violate our community standards, are prohibited and may be removed. In all cases, Mcave reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether particular content is in violation of our community standards.

            Ads may not constitute, facilitate or promote illegal activity.
            B.    Harassment

            C.    Hate Speech
            Ads may not contain "hate speech," whether directed at an individual or a group, based on membership within certain categories. These categories include, but are not limited to, race, sex, creed, national origin, religious affiliation, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or language.
            D.    Minors
            Ads that are targeted to minors may not promote products or services that are illegal for use by minors in their jurisdiction, or that are deemed to be unsafe or inappropriate.

            Ads may not be shocking, sensational or disrespectful, or portray excessive violence.
            VI.    Mcave References
            Ads may not imply a Mcave endorsement or partnership of any kind. Ads linking to Mcave branded content (including Pages, groups, events, or Connect sites) may make limited reference to "Mcave" in ad text for the purpose of clarifying the destination of the ad. All other ads and landing pages may not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Mcave, the Mcave and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Book, and Wall) or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
            VII.    Rights of Others
            Ads may not include content that infringes upon or violates the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights.

            We reserve the right to reject, approve or remove any ad for any reason, in our sole discretion, including ads that negatively affect our relationship with our users or that promote content, services, or activities, contrary to our competitive position, interests, or advertising philosophy. These guidelines are subject to change at any time.




            45.	Mcave Pages Promotional Terms
            The following terms, as well as our Data Use Policy and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, apply to all Pages on Mcave. Additionally, all content on Pages must comply with our Community Standards. You are responsible for ensuring that your Page complies with all applicable laws, statutes, and regulations.

            I.    General
            A.    A Page for a brand, entity (place or organization), or public figure may be administered only by an authorized representative of that brand, entity (place or organization) or public figure (an “official Page”).
            B.    Any user may create a Page to express support for or interest in a brand, entity (place or organization), or public figure, provided that it does not mislead others into thinking it is an official Page, or violate someone's rights. If your Page is not the official Page of a brand, entity (place or organization) or public figure, you must:
            i.    not speak in the voice of, or post content as though it was coming from, the authorized representative of the Page’s subject matter; and
            ii.    make clear that the Page is not the official Page of the brand, entity (place or organization) or public figure.
            C.    Content posted to a Page is public and viewable by everyone who can see the Page.
            D.    You are required to restrict access to Pages (through our gating functionality) as necessary to comply with applicable laws and Mcave policies, including our Advertising Guidelines and Community Standards.
            E.    You may not establish terms for your Page that conflict with our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, Data Use Policy or these terms.
            II.    Page Management
            A.    Page Names and Mcave Web Addresses
            Page names and Mcave Web Addresses must accurately reflect Page content. We may remove administrative rights or require you to change the Page name and Mcave Web Address for any Page that fails to meet this requirement.
            Page names must:
            i.    not consist solely of generic terms (e.g., “beer” or “pizza”);
            ii.    use proper, grammatically correct capitalization and may not include all capitals, except for acronyms;
            iii.    not include character symbols, such as excessive punctuation and trademark designations;
            iv.    not include superfluous descriptions or unnecessary qualifiers;
            v.    not mislead others into thinking it is an official Page of the Page’s subject matter or is authorized by an authorized representative of the Page’s subject matter; and
            vi.    not violate someone’s rights.
            B.    Name Changes and Migrations
            We will only process name changes and migrations that do not result in a misleading or unintended connection. For example, we will allow local to global migrations, such as “Mcave France” to “Mcave”, but will not allow global to local migrations, or location to location migrations, such as “Mcave France” to “Mcave Russia”. Additionally, you may not request a name change or migration that would result in re-categorizing a product Page to a brand Page, a generic or opinion Page to a brand Page, or a Group to a Page. All migrations are at our discretion and are final.
            C.    Collection of Data
            If you collect content and information directly from users, you will make it clear that you (and not Mcave) are collecting it, and you will provide notice about and obtain user consent for your use of the content and information that you collect. Regardless of how you obtain content and information from users, you are responsible for securing all necessary permissions to reuse their content and information.
            You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Mcave, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.
            Any data you obtain from us must comply with Section II of our Mcave Platform Policies.
            D.    Tagging
            You must not inaccurately tag content or encourage users to inaccurately tag content (ex: don’t encourage people to tag themselves in photos if they aren’t in the photo).
            III.    Page Features
            A.    Advertising on Pages
            Third-party advertisements on Pages are prohibited, without our prior permission.
            B.    Cover
            All covers are public. This means that anyone who visits your Page will be able to see your cover. Covers can't be deceptive, misleading, or infringe on anyone else's copyright. You may not encourage people to upload your cover to their personal timelines.
            C.    Applications on Pages
            Apps on your Page must comply with the Mcave Platform Policies.
            D.    Offers
            If you create an offer using Mcave’s offer creation tool, the following policies apply:
            i.    Mcave offers must be available for a limited time.
            ii.    You may only run an offer if you are the merchant for or the manufacturer of the product or service you are promoting.
            iii.    You must clearly and prominently disclose any restrictions on your offer (such as expiration date or limitations on redemption).
            iv.    You are solely responsible for improper redemption, fraud, disputes or other issues that arise from the distribution and/or redemption of your offer.
            v.    If your offer may be redeemed at a merchant not operated by you, it is your sole responsibility to communicate with the merchant and ensure they honor your offer.
            vi.    You must only use the offer creation tool for its intended functionality and not to promote your website or other contact information, or to offer the equivalent of a gift card, gift certificate or stored value card.
            vii.    You are responsible for ensuring that your offer complies with these terms and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Offers are subject to many regulations (such as alcohol discounts and offers marketed to minors) and if you are not certain that your offer complies with applicable law, consult with an expert.
            E.    Promotions
            1. If you use Mcave to communicate or administer a promotion (ex: a contest or sweepstakes), you are responsible for the lawful operation of that promotion, including:
            a.   The official rules;
            b.   Offer terms and eligibility requirements (ex: age and residency restrictions); and
            c.   Compliance with applicable rules and regulations governing the promotion and all prizes offered (ex: registration and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals)
            2. Promotions on Mcave must include the following:
            a.   A complete release of Mcave by each entrant or participant.
            b.   Acknowledgement that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Mcave..





            46.	Mcave Community Standards
            Mcave gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Mcave – and the opinions expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Mcave. 

            To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Mcave protects expression that meets the community standards outlined on this page. 

            Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of content may be reported and removed.
            Violence and Threats
            Safety is Mcave's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and vandalism.
            Self-Harm
            Mcave takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for people in distress.
            Bullying and Harassment
            Mcave does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.
            Hate Speech
            Mcave does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.
            Graphic Content
            Mcave has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. 

            When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch it.
            Nudity and Pornography
            Mcave has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding, howver, nudity is prohibited.
            Identity and Privacy
            On Mcave people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent. Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Mcave's terms.
            Intellectual Property
            Before sharing content on Mcave, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.
            Phishing and Spam
            We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.
            Security
            We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security, including those that use fraud or deception. Additionally, we ask that you respect our members by not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.
            Reporting Abuse
            If you see something on Mcave that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us. Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. 

            Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.










            47.	Cookies, Pixels & Similar Technologies
            How Cookies Work
            Cookies and other similar technologies help provide a better, faster and safer experience.
            Technologies like cookies, pixel tags ("pixels"), and local storage are used to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads, on and off Mcave. We want this page to help you understand more about these technologies and how they are used. Your browser or device may allow you to block these technologies, but you may not be able to use some features on Mcave if you block them. For more information about whether these tools are available, what they do and how they work, visit your browser or device's help material. Generally, tools like these in your browser or device affect only that particular browser or device. So if you’re using multiple browsers or devices, you can make different choices for each of them.
            Check back here from time to time to get the latest information about these technologies and how they are used.
            What are cookies, pixels, local storage and similar technologies?
            We and our affiliates, third parties, and other partners (“partners”) use these technologies for security purposes and to deliver products, services and advertisements, as well as to understand how these products, services and advertisements are used. With these technologies, a website or application can store information on your browser or device and later read that information back. We explain more about each of these technologies and how they are used on this page.
            Why do we use these technologies?
            Show what matters to you
            Improve your experience
            Protection and security
            They help us know who you are so we can show content that’s most relevant to you, including features, products, and ads.
            They work with Mcave features and help us improve our products and services – so you can do things like see which friends are online in chat, use share buttons, and upload photos.
            They help secure Mcave by letting us know if someone tries to access your account or engages in activity that violates our terms.

            Categories of use
            Examples
            Authentication
            These tools tell us when you’re logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features. 

            For example, cookies, local storage and similar technologies tell us when you are logged in to Mcave so we can show you relevant and social information when you visit other websites that use our social plugins. We also use this information to understand how people use our Platform and other apps and services.
            Security and site integrity
            We use these to help keep Mcave safe and secure. They support or enable security features and help us detect activity that violates our belief of Rights and Responsibilities. 

            For example, they help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you. Cookies also let us know when several people have logged in from the same computer.
            Advertising
            Things like cookies and pixels are used to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. 

            For example, we may read a cookie so we can show you ads that may be interesting to you on Mcave or other websites. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad on Mcave later visited the advertiser’s site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie or another similar technology to determine whether we’ve shown an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. We also may work with a partner to show you an ad on or off Mcave, such as after you’ve visited the partner’s site or app and this may involve the use of cookies, local storage on your device or other similar technologies.
            Localization
            These help Mcave provide a localized experience. 

            For example, we may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.
            Site features and services
            These provide functionality that help us deliver products and services. 

            For example, cookies help you log in by pre-filling the username field and help make chat a better experience by showing which of your friends are online. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social plugins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others.
            Performance
            We use these to provide you with the best experience possible. 

            For example, we may use a cookie to help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Mcave loads for different people. Sometimes we may store information on your browser or device so Mcave features you are using load and respond faster.
            Analytics and research
            These are used to understand, improve, and research products and services, including when you access Mcave or other websites and apps from a computer or mobile device. 

            For example, we may use cookies to understand how you are using social plugins to improve them. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use websites, apps, products, services and ads. We may share information about this analysis with our partners.
            The specific names of the cookies, pixels and other similar technologies that we use may change from time to time, but they generally will fall into the above categories.
